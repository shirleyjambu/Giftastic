Fun with Gifs

Used Giphy API to creat a dynamic page that populates with gifs.
Built using HTML,CSS,JS,JQuery & ajax calls.

# Instructions

1. The Page loads with some buttons already loaded.

2. When the user clicks on a button, 10 still images are loaded from the GIPHY API.

3. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif would animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it would stop playing.

5. Every image displays the rating ,title along with it.

6. The user can add his own button by adding a value in the input provided and retreive images for it.

7. The images could be downloaded using the Download link.


Pending

1. Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

5. Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

6. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
   * This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
   * If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
